20190909 NeuroFedora
---------------------

These are the slides for our talk on NeuroFedora_ at the `Open Source Brain
workshop <http://www.opensourcebrain.org/docs/Help/Meetings#OSB_2019>`__.

All the text is in :code:`20190909_neurofedora.tex`. The other files are merely
used to generate different outputs. Generally, it is enough to modify the main
file and then use the Makefile to generate all the outputs.

Dependencies
=============

On a Fedora system, please :code:`make deps` to install the required TeXlive
packages from the repositories using :code:`dnf`.
